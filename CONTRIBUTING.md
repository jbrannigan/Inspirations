## Required GitHub Flow For Major Features

Use this process whenever you add a major feature or make a substantial behavior change.

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Implement the change with tests.
3. Update documentation in the same branch.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Merge only after review.

Direct merges of major features to `main` are not allowed.

## README Update Policy

`README.md` must be updated in the same PR when a feature is:

- Added
- Removed
- Substantially changed

This includes changes to setup, command usage, APIs, and user-facing workflows.

If you believe no README change is needed, state that explicitly in the PR checklist.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Scope is clear and limited to a coherent feature/change.
- [ ] Tests were added/updated where appropriate.
- [ ] `README.md` was updated for added/removed/substantially changed features.
- [ ] `docs/pr_summary.md` was updated when behavior changed.
